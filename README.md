# Basic Search Engine
### This is just a project to simulate the search process. So results will not be expected as a real search engine like Google. 

I'm Vietnamese so my English might not be good enough. So if there are any mistakes, please forgive me.

**Description: This program will take your search keyword and then return results including the page name, the link and the search results from each previously crawled links.**

> Note 1: This program will start crawling again every time it runs. So consider each run to avoid wasting time.
>
> Note 2: This program start from a specific url given by start_url variable. So it will find information within that url.
